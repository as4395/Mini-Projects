- Includes tips to identify phishing attempts

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- `email` and `smtplib` standard libraries (built-in)
- Optionally `faker` for generating fake user data (`pip install faker`)

## How to Use
**1.** Install dependencies (if using faker):
  ```bash
   pip install faker
  ```
**2.** Run the simulation script:
  ```bash
  python3 src/phishing_email_sim.py
  ```

**3.** Follow the prompts to generate and display a phishing email example.

**4.** Review the educational tips on how to detect phishing.
