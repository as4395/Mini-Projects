# Buffer Overflow Auto-Payload Generator

## Description
This tool automates the generation of payloads for buffer overflow exploitation. It is primarily designed to help in the initial fuzzing and offset discovery stage by creating custom-length patterns, identifying exact offset values from crashes, and generating exploit skeletons. This is commonly used when exploiting stack-based buffer overflows in CTF-style binaries.

## Features
- Generate cyclic patterns to identify buffer size
- Analyze crash values (e.g., EIP/RIP) to find exact offset in pattern
- Output compatible payloads for different architectures (x86/x64)
- Automatically generate `gdb` commands to test payloads
- Useful for initial fuzzing and exploitation stages

## Installation
Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Generate a cyclic pattern
```bash
python bof_payloadgen.py --pattern 300
```

### Find the offset of a crash value
```bash
python bof_payloadgen.py --offset AAAAaAAa --length 300
```

### Generate a sample payload with NOP sled and shellcode
```bash
python bof_payloadgen.py --payload --offset 112 --arch x86
```

## Notes
- The tool supports both `x86` and `x64` (default: `x64`).
- Does not perform actual exploitation â€” only generates input strings for manual or scripted exploitation.
- Intended for use in safe, authorized testing environments such as CTFs and labs.
