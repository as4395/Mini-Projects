# Format String Exploiter

## Description
This tool assists in analyzing and exploiting basic format string vulnerabilities in local binaries or remote services. It automates common payload generation, stack offset discovery, and leak extraction. It is useful during CTFs or binary exploitation assessments where a format string bug is identified.

## Features
- Discover the correct offset for format string input
- Leak memory values using format string payloads
- Send payloads to local or remote targets
- Optional integration with `pwntools` for remote exploits

## Installation
Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Discover Offset
```bash
python format_exploiter.py --discover-offset
```
### Leak Stack Value
```bash
python format_exploiter.py --leak --index 6
```
### Custom Payload to Local/Remote
```bash
python format_exploiter.py --target localhost --port 1337 --payload "%8$s"
```

## Notes

- Offset discovery is based on automated cyclic payload reflection.
- Ensure the binary or service echoes back your input for analysis.
- This tool does not exploit format strings that require custom shellcode or GOT overwrite â€” it is meant for basic leaking and offset detection.
