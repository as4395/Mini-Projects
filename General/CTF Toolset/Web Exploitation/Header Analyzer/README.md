# Header Analyzer

## Description
This tool inspects HTTP response headers from a given URL and highlights potentially suspicious or missing security-related headers. It's commonly used in CTF Web challenges to detect insecure server configurations and missing best practices like CSP, HSTS, or X-Frame-Options.

## Features
- Sends a HEAD or GET request to a target URL
- Extracts all response headers
- Flags security misconfigurations or risky header values
- Human-readable report printed to console

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```bash
python3 header_analyzer.py <target_url>
```

Example:

```bash
python3 header_analyzer.py https://example.com
```

## Notes
- Works best against web servers responding with meaningful headers (HEAD/GET).
- Supports HTTP and HTTPS endpoints.
- For educational, penetration testing, and CTF use only.
