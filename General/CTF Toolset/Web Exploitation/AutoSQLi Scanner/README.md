# AutoSQLi Scanner

## Description
The AutoSQLi Scanner is a command-line tool that automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities in web applications. It supports basic and advanced SQL injection techniques, including error-based, time-based blind, and boolean-based blind detection. This tool is ideal for Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions and educational penetration testing in authorized environments.

## Features
- Detects SQL injection vulnerabilities in GET parameters
- Supports:
  - Error-based detection
  - Boolean-based blind SQL injection
  - Time-based blind SQL injection
- Automatically injects payloads and analyzes responses
- Highlights vulnerable parameters and points of failure
- Optional verbose mode for detailed response behavior
- Clean and modular structure for easy extensibility

## Installation
Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```bash
cd src/
python autosqli.py -u "http://example.com/page.php?id=1"
```

### Options
- `-u, --url` — Target URL with a vulnerable parameter
- `-v, --verbose` — Enable verbose output to show full response details

## Notes
- Currently supports GET-based parameter injection
- Blind SQLi techniques include:
  - **Boolean-based**: Injects conditions that evaluate true/false and compares responses
  - **Time-based**: Uses database-specific sleep/delay functions to infer execution flow
- Designed for educational and CTF purposes only. Do **not** use against unauthorized systems.
