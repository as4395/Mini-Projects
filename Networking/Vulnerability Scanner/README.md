# Vulnerability Scanner

This project integrates with the open-source vulnerability scanner **Nuclei** to automate scanning of target IPs or domains. It fetches vulnerability templates, runs scans, and parses the results for critical findings.

## Features

- Installs Nuclei if not found
- Automatically fetches latest vulnerability templates
- Scans single IP/domain or list from file
- Parses Nuclei JSON output and highlights high/critical vulnerabilities

## Usage

1. **Install requirements (only needed once):**

```bash
pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt
```
Run scanner:
```bash
python3 src/vuln_scanner.py -t <target>
```
Scan single target:
```bash
python3 src/vuln_scanner.py -t example.com
```
Scan from file:
```bash
python3 src/vuln_scanner.py -f targets.txt
```

## Notes

- This tool depends on `nuclei` binary from https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei
- The script will download and set it up if it's not already installed.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- `nuclei` binary (installed automatically if missing)
