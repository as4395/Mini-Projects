# SQL Vulnerability Assessment

## Description
This project demonstrates how SQL Injection vulnerabilities occur by simulating a simple user login system that does not use parameterized queries. It includes an interactive script that sets up a sample SQLite database and allows users to test both normal logins and SQL injection attacks in a safe environment.

## Features
- Sets up a local SQLite database with sample user credentials
- Simulates a vulnerable login prompt with raw SQL string interpolation
- Accepts user input for SQL injection testing
- Prints the exact SQL query being executed
- Educational use only â€” highlights importance of query sanitization

## Installation
No external Python libraries are required.

To install the standard library dependencies and run the script, ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.

```bash
pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the script from the `src` directory:

```bash
cd src/
python sql_vuln_assessment.py
```

You will be prompted to choose one of the following:

```
1. Setup database
2. Attempt vulnerable login
```

Choose (1) to initialize the database. Then choose (2) to simulate a login, with the ability to test SQL injection strings such as:

```sql
' OR '1'='1
```

## Notes
- The code is intentionally insecure to help you understand how SQL Injection works.
- Never use raw string formatting in real-world database queries.
- For security, always use parameterized queries or an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper).
